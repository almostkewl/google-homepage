Create a copy of Google's homepage. Easy version just the homepage. Difficult version, do the search results page!! Both sound great. Going to use and get comfortable with GIT along the way. Using VSCode. When finished I will post to Codepen.  Started this yesterday 2/20/2020.

Sidenote: Parker has been on vacation due to the Coronavirus. It's been hard to make the time and get into a schedule. He's going back to school next Tuesday!!

Update: March 4th!!! Finally finished. 2 things I didn't get. navbar has a left margin not sure how to fix. Bottom double footer couldn't get a border line in the middle.

Icons in the searchbar took forever!!! Finally asked in dischord after a 3 hour try yesterday. Carlos sent me to the right Stack Overflow page. **Place an image inside a text field. I was searching for the wrong thing.
